## the gum machine
the gum machine is from Ralph Grimaldi's book, section 6.1 (FSMs, the first
encounter). it accepts nickles, dimes and quarters (5, 10 and 25 cents) and you
can buy two flavors of gum with it (using the white (W) for peppermint (P) or
black (B) for spearmint (S)). any flavor of gum costs 20 cents. the machine
should return the change as well.

when machine outputs `n`, means nothing is returned. this can also be done with
an empty string (`s0,5 > s1,`)

## the binary addition machine
adds two binary numbers of any length together. the output is the reversed string
of the actual outputted number
