## the gum machine
the gum machine is from Ralph Grimaldi's book, section 6.1 (FSMs, the first
encounter). it accpets nickles, dimes and quarters (5, 10 and 25 cents) and you
can buy two flavors of gum with it (using the white (W) for peppermint (P) or
black (B) for spearmint (S)). any flavor of gum costs 20 cents. the machine
should return the change as well

## the binary addition machine
adds two binary numbers of anylength together. the output is the reversed string
of the actual outputed number
